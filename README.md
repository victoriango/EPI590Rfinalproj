EPI590R R Bootcamp - Final Project, August 2024
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository belongs to Victoria Ngo.

The chosen dataset for this final project was web-scraped from the IKEA Saudi Arabian website for the furniture category on April 20, 2020. This was featured by the TidyTuesday data set repository on November 11, 2020 (tidytuesday/data/2020/2020-11-03). This data set contains information on the furniture item's name, category, price, online availability, web link, colors available, depth, width, height, designer, and a short description of each item.

To run this code, you can access the dataset in the "Data" folder under the name "ikea.csv". Read and render the "R script for final proj" R file, then render the Quarto file "Quarto script for final proj.qmd". Both script files can be accessed in the "R and Quarto" folder. No additional cleaning needs to be done to this dataset prior to usage.

The saved histogram figure can be accessed in the "Figure" folder of the project!
